# OOPS-in-Python

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks that cover various concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. The notebooks are designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of OOP principles and demonstrate their implementation in Python.

## Notebooks

### 1. Classes and Instances.ipynb
This notebook introduces the fundamental concepts of classes and instances in Python. It covers:
- Defining a class
- Creating instances of a class
- Understanding `self` and instance variables
- Implementing methods in a class

### 2. Inheritance.ipynb
This notebook explains the concept of inheritance, which allows one class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. Topics include:
- Defining a subclass
- Overriding methods
- Using the `super()` function
- Understanding method resolution order (MRO)

### 3. Methods.ipynb
This notebook delves into different types of methods in Python classes, including:
- Instance methods
- Class methods
- Static methods
- When and how to use each type of method

### 4. Property Decorators.ipynb
This notebook covers property decorators, which are used to manage the attributes of a class. It includes:
- Using `@property` decorator to create getters
- Creating setters with `@property_name.setter`
- Understanding the benefits of using property decorators

### 5. Special (Dunder & Magic) Methods.ipynb
This notebook explores special methods (also known as dunder or magic methods) that allow custom behavior for built-in operations. Topics include:
- Common special methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, and `__repr__`
- Overloading operators using special methods
- Customizing object behavior with special methods
